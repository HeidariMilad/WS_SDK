top_issues:
  - id: "REL-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Demo UI connection states and error messaging are only manually validated; there are no automated integration tests exercising ConnectionBanner and connection lifecycle behavior."
    suggested_action: "Add integration tests in apps/demo to cover connection lifecycle (connect, transient disconnect, repeated failures, offline) and verify the banner and events panel render expected states without crashes."
  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Backoff, offline, and reconnection edge cases are not validated in a browser-like environment beyond unit tests of the backoff logic."
    suggested_action: "Introduce browser/E2E tests (e.g., Playwright or similar) to simulate flaky network conditions and confirm reconnection/backoff behavior does not degrade UX or stability."
