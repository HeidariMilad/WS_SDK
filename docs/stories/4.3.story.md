# Story 4.3 – README & Developer Guide

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As a** developer or evaluator,
**I want** clear documentation for setup, usage, and command behaviors,
**so that** I can quickly understand, run, and extend the SDK and demo.

## Acceptance Criteria

From PRD Epic 4 – Demo Application & Documentation:

1. AC1: README covers prerequisites, installation, run instructions, and command walkthrough.
2. AC2: SDK package README documents APIs, configuration, and integration snippets.
3. AC3: Stretch goals are clearly labeled with implementation status.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1 – Root README for monorepo (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Document prerequisites (Node version, package manager, etc.) and initial setup steps.  
        [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#project-structure--workflow]
  - [ ] Provide commands for running demo, mocks, tests, and builds.
  - [ ] Include a section summarizing stretch goals and whether they are implemented.

- [ ] Task 2 – SDK package README (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Document public SDK APIs, including connection setup, command handling, and AI button factory.  
        [Source: architecture/overview-and-modules.md#module-boundaries]
  - [ ] Provide code snippets showing how to integrate the SDK into a host app.
  - [ ] Clearly mark experimental or stretch features.

- [ ] Task 3 – Demo usage and commands walkthrough (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Describe how to use the demo UI, including the showcase page, logger, and chatbot.  
        [Source: front-end-spec.md#user-flows]
  - [ ] Explain how commands map to visible effects and log entries.

- [ ] Task 4 – Architecture and design references (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Link from README(s) to PRD, architecture, and UX docs for deeper context.  
        [Source: docs/prd.md, docs/architecture/index.md, docs/front-end-spec.md]
  - [ ] Summarize key architectural decisions that affect integrators.

- [ ] Task 5 – Maintenance and contribution notes (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Outline how to run tests, add new commands, and update docs.
  - [ ] Clarify any guidelines for PRs or code reviews (if relevant).

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- All prior stories implement the technical capabilities; this story captures them in documentation form.

### Implementation Playbook (Dev Agent)

Follow these steps when implementing this story:

1. **Root README**
   - Document prerequisites, installation, and commands to run demo, mocks, tests, and builds.
   - Summarize stretch goals and mark their implementation status.

2. **SDK README**
   - Document public SDK APIs (connection setup, command handling, AI button factory) with code examples.
   - Call out experimental or stretch features clearly.

3. **Demo walkthrough**
   - Describe how to use the demo UI, including the showcase page, logger, chatbot, and what each command does.

4. **Architecture/design references**
   - Link to PRD, architecture, and UX docs.
   - Summarize key architectural choices relevant to integrators.

5. **Maintenance & contribution**
   - Outline how to run tests, add commands, and update docs; note any contribution practices if needed.

Dev should keep Tasks/Subtasks and Dev Notes aligned with actual documentation; QA Results are for QA.

### Data Models

- N/A – documentation only.

### API Specifications

- Ensure documentation matches the actual public API signatures and types exported by SDK and shared packages.

### Component Specifications

- N/A – documentation only.

### File Locations & Structure

- Root README: `README.md` at monorepo root.
- SDK README: `packages/sdk/README.md`.

### Testing Requirements

- Manual validation that documented commands and scripts run successfully.
- Optional: link checker or linting for markdown.

### Technical Constraints & Considerations

- Documentation must stay aligned with actual implementations; avoid speculative features.

## Testing

- Follow documentation from a clean checkout to ensure steps work end-to-end.

## QA Results

### QA Validation Playbook

When this story is ready for QA review:

1. **Verify Acceptance Criteria directly**
   - AC1: Follow the root README from a fresh checkout and confirm prerequisites, installation, and run commands work.
   - AC2: Validate that the SDK README accurately documents APIs and integration snippets.
   - AC3: Confirm stretch goals are clearly labeled with implementation status.

2. **Consistency checks**
   - Ensure docs match actual behavior of commands, scripts, and APIs.

3. **Record QA result**
   - Summarize findings with status (READY / NEEDS REVISION / BLOCKED) and any documentation gaps.

_This section is reserved for the QA Agent to record validation results and gate decisions for this story._
